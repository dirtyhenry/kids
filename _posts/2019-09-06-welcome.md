Kids is a Jekyll theme I wrote to have a decent theme base for all my Jekyll
sites â€” which I have way too many of.

## My objectives for Kids

I want Kids to be a theme that:

- is minimal in features and scaffolding;
- has a small footprint;
- uses modern tools;
- is accessible;
- is readable with good typography.

## Why Kids?

As a tribute to _Stranger Things_, because [_Kids_][kids-song] is a great theme.

  This theme is going staleâ€¦ in sync with the rest of the Jekyll community I
  believe.

I don't think Jekyll and its community are doing great these days.

Most of the few plugins this theme is relying on don't seem to be maintained
anymore. I just brought some light edits that will likely be the last.

As I write this post, I am still using the theme on my 2 blogs:

- [Dead Rooster](https://deadrooster.org/), about pop-culture, written in French
- [Bootstragram](https://bootstragram.com/), about development, written in
  English
